# Webex
All things about Cisco Webex that I have come across or created in my travels.

Scripts:
* *Cisco Webex Meeting - 1 - Set name-email-guestmode.sh* - Script to close Cisco Webex Meeting if open and remove login item from current user's account.
* *Cisco Webex Meeting - 2 - Disable Open at Login.sh* - Script to set name, email in guest mode for current user's account when using webex.
